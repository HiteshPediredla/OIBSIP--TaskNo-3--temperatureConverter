# OIBSIP--TaskNo-3--temperatureConverter
I'm excited to share my latest project - a temperature converter website I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a user-friendly tool that allows you to input a temperature value in degrees, select either Fahrenheit or Kelvin, and instantly get the converted result in Celsius with a single click.

ðŸ“Š Features:

Input your temperature value in the "Degrees" field.
Choose your desired conversion type: Fahrenheit or Kelvin.
Click the "Convert" button.
VoilÃ ! The converted temperature is displayed in Celsius format in the "Result" field.

I had a blast developing this tool, and it's a great example of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can come together to create practical and user-friendly applications.
