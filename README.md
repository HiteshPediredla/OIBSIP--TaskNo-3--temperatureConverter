# OIBSIP--TaskNo-3--temperatureConverter
I'm excited to share my latest project - a temperature converter website I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a user-friendly tool that allows you to input a temperature value in degrees, select either Fahrenheit or Kelvin, and instantly get the converted result in Celsius with a single click.
